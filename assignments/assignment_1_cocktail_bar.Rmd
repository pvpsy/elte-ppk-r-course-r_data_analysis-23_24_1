# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(rmarkdown)
library(conflicted)
conflicts_prefer(dplyr::filter)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
setwd("C:/Rprojects/cocktail-balance")
data <- read_tsv("cocktail_data.tsv")
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
cleaned_data <- data %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>|<br>|<b4/>")
print(head(cleaned_data))
```

```{r}
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub("^\\d+(\\.\\d+)?\\s*(oz|drops|drop|dash|dashes|bsp)?\\s*", "", ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub("^(\\s*)?\\d+(\\/\\d+)?\\s*(oz)?\\s*", "", ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub("^\\/\\d+\\s*(\\w+\\s+)?\\s*", "", ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub("\\s*\\([^)]+\\)$", "", ingredients))

print(head(cleaned_data))
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  arrange(ingredients)
print(head(cleaned_data)) 
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
sum_ingredients_type <- cleaned_data %>%
  distinct(ingredients) %>%
  nrow()

print(sum_ingredients_type)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
top_ingredients <- cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  top_n(10)

print(top_ingredients)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
cocktail_ingr_count <- cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(num_ingredients = n_distinct(ingredients)) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_ingredients))
  
max_ingredients <- max(cocktail_ingr_count$num_ingredients)

cocktails_with_most_ingredients <- cocktail_ingr_count %>%
  filter(num_ingredients == max_ingredients)

print(cocktails_with_most_ingredients)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
rare_ingredient <- cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(num_unique_cocktails = n_distinct(name)) %>%
  filter(num_unique_cocktails == 1) %>%
  ungroup()

num_rare_ingredients <- nrow(rare_ingredient)
print(num_rare_ingredients)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
unique_ingredients <- rare_ingredient$ingredients

cocktails_with_unique_ingredient <- cleaned_data %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% unique_ingredients) %>%
  distinct(name)

print(cocktails_with_unique_ingredient)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
 cocktails_without_unique_ingredients <- cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  filter(all(!ingredients %in% unique_ingredients)) %>%
  distinct(name)

print(cocktails_without_unique_ingredients)  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty.

```{r}
cocktail_matrix <- cleaned_data %>%
  select("name", "ingredients") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = ingredients, values_from = ingredients, values_fn = function(x) ifelse(length(x) > 0, "X", ""), values_fill = "")
  
print(cocktail_matrix)
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
